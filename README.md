# sig-server

This is a fork of [OgarII](https://github.com/Luka967/OgarII) that implements [Sigmally](https://sigmally.com)'s custom protocol and settings.

It also includes server-side bot support and training dummy commands for creating frozen target cells in the world.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+ (or a supported version for your native module build)
- `npm` for dependencies
- On Windows: Python and native build tools for `node-gyp` if the native addon needs compilation

## Install and compile

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install
```

This does two things:

1. installs JavaScript dependencies (`ws`, `bindings`, etc.)
2. compiles the native C core in `src/ccore/` using `node-gyp`

If the native build fails, install the Windows build environment and retry:

```bash
npm rebuild
```

## Run the server

Start the CLI server:

```bash
node cli/index.js
```

The server starts in an interactive command mode. Once the CLI is loaded, run:

```bash
start
```

Then use these commands:

- `start` — start the server
- `stop` — stop the server
- `exit` — stop and exit
- `reload` — reload settings from `settings.json`

The first run will create `settings.json` from defaults if it does not exist.

## Connect clients

Use one of these clients:

- Sigmally Fixes: `https://one.sigmally.com?ip=ws://localhost/sigmally.com`
- Delta: `ws://localhost` (legacy protocol)
- Delta: `ws://localhost/sigmally.com` (Sigmally protocol)

## Training dummies and bots

New commands are available to spawn frozen dummy targets and bots.

### Add a dummy target

```bash
adddummy <world id> <x> <y> <size> [name] [skin] [color]
```

Example:

```bash
adddummy 1 0 0 100 Dummy 1%Alexander 16711680
```

This creates a frozen player-like cell at coordinates `x`, `y` with the specified size.

### Remove dummy targets

```bash
rmdummy <world id> [count=1]
```

### Existing bot commands

- `addbot <world id> [count=1]`
- `rmbot <world id> [count=1]`

## Settings

All server settings are loaded from `settings.json`. If the file is missing, the server creates it from the defaults in `src/Settings.js`.

## Compile to a Windows executable

This repository is a Node.js server with native bindings. You can package it into a standalone Windows EXE using a packager such as `pkg` or `nexe`, but you first need to build the native module.

### Option 1: `pkg`

1. Install `pkg` globally:

```bash
npm install -g pkg
```

2. Build the exe from the repo root:

```bash
pkg cli/index.js --targets node18-win-x64 --output sig-server.exe
```

If the native `.node` binding is not included automatically, build it first with `npm install` or `npm rebuild`, then copy the compiled binary from `build/Release/` alongside the generated EXE.

## GitHub Actions workflows

This project includes two workflows:

- `.github/workflows/build-exe.yml` — runs on `push` to `main` and manually via the Actions UI; builds `sig-server.exe` and uploads it as a workflow artifact.
- `.github/workflows/release-exe.yml` — runs when a GitHub release is published; builds `sig-server.exe` and uploads it directly to the release assets.

### Build workflow

The build workflow is useful for CI artifact generation without publishing a release. It compiles the EXE and stores it in the workflow run artifacts.

### Release workflow

The release workflow runs automatically when a release is published and attaches `sig-server.exe` to the GitHub release.

## Notes

- The server uses `settings.json` in the current working directory.
- If you want to customize a setting, edit `settings.json` and run `reload` in the CLI.
- `adddummy` creates training targets that look like player cells but remain frozen.
- The native core is in `src/ccore/`; if the build fails, install required build tools for your platform.
